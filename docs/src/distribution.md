# Distributions

## Introduction

The package includes a collection of probabilistic distributions and related
functions. The implementation is heavily influenced by the package
[Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl), but extends
it to allow for weighted distributions as well as the
[Unitful.jl](https://github.com/PainterQubits/Unitful.jl) parameters.

## Distributions

Each distribution has a number of constructors, both based on its full name and
abbreviation, e.g., `Weibull()` is equivalent to `ùëæ()`. Furthermore,
additional constructors are included for limited input, where all remaining
parameters are set to their default, e.g., `Weibull(10.0u"hr")` is equivalent
to `Weibull(10.0u"hr",1.0,1.0)`.

All input parameters are either of the type `Number` or its subtype `Real`:
```
Number
 |- Unitful.Quantity, e.g., 10.0u"hr"
 |- Real
     |- AbstractFloat, e.g., 10.0
     |- Integer, e.g., 10
```

All distributions may be scaled using a weight parameter `œâ`, where
`0.0 < œâ ‚â§ 1.0`.
