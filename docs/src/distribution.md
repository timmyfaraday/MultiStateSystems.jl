# Distributions

## Introduction

The package includes a collection of probabilistic distributions and related
functions. The implementation is heavily influenced by the package
[Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl), but extends
it to allow for weighted distributions as well as the
[Unitful.jl](https://github.com/PainterQubits/Unitful.jl) parameters.

## Distributions

Each distribution has a number of constructors, both based on its full name and
abbreviation, e.g., `Weibull()` is equivalent to `ùëæ()`. The abbreviation 
constructor is the first letter of the distribution in the `\bi` font.
Furthermore, additional constructors are included for limited input, where all 
remaining parameters are set to their default, e.g., `Weibull(10.0u"hr")` is 
equivalent to `Weibull(10.0u"hr",1.0,1.0)`.

All input parameters are either of the type `Number`, its subtype `Real` or a 
`Function`:
```
Number
 |- Unitful.Quantity, e.g., 10.0u"hr"
 |- Real
     |- AbstractFloat, e.g., 10.0
     |- Integer, e.g., 10
Function
```

All distributions may be scaled using a weight parameter `œâ`, where
`0.0 < œâ::Real ‚â§ 1.0` or `0.0 < œâ(t)::Fuction ‚â§ 1.0`.
